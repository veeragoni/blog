**This blog post is a collaboration between human and AI. It was co-authored by me (Suresh Veeragoni) and Google Antigravity. We wrote this together: I provided the brain, and the agent was the workhorse.**

I recently watched the announcement for **Google Antigravity**, a new agentic development platform from Google DeepMind. Instead of just writing a summary myself, I decided to put the tool to the test. I gave it a prompt, a link to the video, and asked it to be the agent that writes this blog.

So, this is a meta-review: an AI agent explaining itself, from inside the IDE it controls.

### The Prompt
I started by giving Antigravity a simple instruction: watch the announcement video, summarize it, and write a blog post in my natural style.

*The actual prompt I used to kick off this task.*

### What is Antigravity?
At its core, Antigravity integrates three key components into a single, intuitive product:

1.  **Agent Manager**: The central hub to manage and create agents.
2.  **Antigravity Editor**: An AI-powered editor (a fork of VS Code) with an agent sidebar.
3.  **Browser Integration**: An agent inside a Chromium-based browser that can interact with the web.

### The "Meta" Experience
What makes this interesting is the workflow. I didn't just paste text into ChatGPT. I stayed in my editor. Antigravity:
1.  **Planned the task**: It created a task list and implementation plan.

2.  **Executed the work**: It cloned my blog repo, created this file, and wrote the content.

3.  **Verified**: It checked the file location and content.

### My Take (As the Human User)
To me, what Google did here is super interesting. They essentially took an IDE, a Browser, and an Agent Orchestrator (Electron-based) and fused them into one experience. It’s not just a chat window; it’s an environment where the model has *hands*.

It’s an experiment, but it shows how UX is evolving. We're moving from "chatting with AI" to "collaborating with AI" inside the tools we already use.

### Update: The "Meta" Debugging
*Even this blog post had a bug, and Antigravity fixed it.*

When I first tried to publish this, the post didn't show up. I asked Antigravity to debug it.
1.  **Investigation**: It analyzed my `package.json` and identified this as a Next.js project.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis**: It dug into `lib/posts.server.ts` and realized that my blog engine expects every post to be in its own folder (e.g., `content/posts/[slug]/index.md`). I had originally just dropped a markdown file into an existing folder.
3.  **The Fix**: It automatically moved the file to `content/posts/google-antigravity/index.md` and even fixed the image assets by moving them to the `public` directory.

It didn't just tell me what was wrong; it just went ahead and fixed the directory structure.

### Update 2: The Build Failure
*And then, the build failed.*

When I added myself as a co-author, the Next.js build crashed on the `/authors` route.
1.  **The Error**: `Error: The provided export path '/authors' doesn't match the '/authors/[author]' page.`
2.  **The Cause**: The author field in the frontmatter was `Google Antigravity, Suresh Veeragoni`. The system was trying to generate a page for that entire string instead of splitting it.
3.  **The Fix**: Antigravity refactored `lib/posts.server.ts` to properly split author names by comma, trim whitespace, and normalize them. It also added "Google Antigravity" to the `authors.ts` config file so I have a proper profile.

Now, we are co-authors on this post.
