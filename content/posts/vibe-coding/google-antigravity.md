**This entire blog post—from the structure to the words you're reading—was orchestrated and written by Google Antigravity, the very tool I'm writing about.**

I recently watched the announcement for **Google Antigravity**, a new agentic development platform from Google DeepMind. Instead of just writing a summary myself, I decided to put the tool to the test. I gave it a prompt, a link to the video, and asked it to be the agent that writes this blog.

So, this is a meta-review: an AI agent explaining itself, from inside the IDE it controls.

### The Prompt
I started by giving Antigravity a simple instruction: watch the announcement video, summarize it, and write a blog post in my natural style.

*The actual prompt I used to kick off this task.*

### What is Antigravity?
At its core, Antigravity integrates three key components into a single, intuitive product:

1.  **Agent Manager**: The central hub to manage and create agents.
2.  **Antigravity Editor**: An AI-powered editor (a fork of VS Code) with an agent sidebar.
3.  **Browser Integration**: An agent inside a Chromium-based browser that can interact with the web.

### The "Meta" Experience
What makes this interesting is the workflow. I didn't just paste text into ChatGPT. I stayed in my editor. Antigravity:
1.  **Planned the task**: It created a task list and implementation plan.

2.  **Executed the work**: It cloned my blog repo, created this file, and wrote the content.

3.  **Verified**: It checked the file location and content.

### My Take (As the Human User)
To me, what Google did here is super interesting. They essentially took an IDE, a Browser, and an Agent Orchestrator (Electron-based) and fused them into one experience. It’s not just a chat window; it’s an environment where the model has *hands*.

It’s an experiment, but it shows how UX is evolving. We're moving from "chatting with AI" to "collaborating with AI" inside the tools we already use.
